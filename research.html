      <h3> research statement</h3>
      The goal of my research is to build systems that can perceive the visual world intelligently and use this understanding to recreate it. I’m interested in designing algorithms for image synthesis that offer expressive mechanisms for control through the use of conditional information (such as other images, sound, geometry, etc) and human interaction. I’m also broadly interested in computational creativity, either in the form of tools that enhance the creative process or  behavior that emerges from autonomous agents. Achieving this will have many useful applications for creating visual art, synthesizing media, and building autonomous agents that can act in the world.
