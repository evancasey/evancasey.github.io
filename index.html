      <h1>Evan Casey</h1>
      
      <p>I am an aspiring artificial intelligence researcher.</p>

      <p>I am broadly interested in the intersection between deep learning and reinforcement learning. My current research is focused on the problem of robotics in unconstrained environments. Specifically, I am interested in: (1) developing new techniques for improving sample efficiency and scalability (2) developing new methods for applying RL successfully to real world robotics tasks (eg. transfer learning, imitation, multi-task objectives). However, there are many interesting problems in machine learning and I hope to work on at least a few of them at some point.
      </p>

      <p>Most recently, I spent 3 months at <a href="http://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> (formerly known as Hacker School) where I studied machine learning and neural networks. Before that, I was a software engineer at <a href="http://tapad.com">Tapad</a> from June 2014 to February 2016 up through the acquisition by the European telecom giant <a href="http://telenor.com">Telenor</a> for 360M. I worked on the petabyte-scale data infrastructure powering their real-time ad bidding systems and the Device Graph, a graph based representation of device ownership that uses a probabilistic model to infer the relationship between devices.

      <p>In my free time I like to <a href="https://vimeo.com/evancasey/videos">skateboard</a>, take <a href="http://yungpruno.tumblr.com">photographs</a>, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/evancasey/">travel</a>.
